# SRA Frontend: Modern SRS Workspace

The SRA Frontend is a premium, type-safe Next.js 15 application designed to visualize and refine complex software requirements using a state-of-the-art interactive workspace.

## 💎 Design Philosophy & Standards

The frontend emphasizes **Visual Excellence** and **Absolute Type Safety**, ensuring a robust developer experience and a professional user interface.

- **Zero-Error Standard**: The project maintains 100% clean linting (Zero errors, zero warnings in critical paths).
- **Strict Typing**: Generic `any` types have been systematically replaced with precise interfaces derived from the backend's `SRSIntakeModel` and `Analysis` schemas.
- **Responsive Aesthetics**: built with Tailwind CSS v4 and Framer Motion for fluid, high-fidelity transitions.

## 🛠️ Feature Breakdown

### The Analysis Workspace
The core of the application, orchestrating complex state across multiple tabs:
- **`ResultsTabs`**: The main container managing synchronization between Diagrams, User Stories, and Appendix items.
- **`KVDisplay`**: A modular component for rendering and editing key-value requirement pairs with auto-generated IDs.
- **`MermaidViewer`**: Client-side rendering and high-res export of system diagrams.

### SRS Versioning & Diffing
- **Visual Versioning**: Browse the project lineage via a dedicated timeline sidebar.
- **Requirement Diffing**: Instant visual feedback of what changed between AI refinement cycles.

### Quality Audit Dashboard
Integrated directly into the workspace, providing real-time Feedback on:
- Requirement clarity/vagueness.
- Technical completeness.
- Architectural consistency.

## 🏁 Getting Started

1. `cd frontend && npm install`
2. Create `.env.local`: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000/api`
3. `npm run dev`

All production-ready code must pass the build and lint checks:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
